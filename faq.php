    <h3 class="myQuestion">When does the course start and finish?</h3>

    <h3 class="myQuestion">How long do I have access to the course?</h3>
    <p class="myAnswer">How does lifetime access sound? After enrolling, you have unlimited access to this course for as long as you like - across any and all devices you own.</p>

    <h3 class="myQuestion">What if I am unhappy with the course?</h3>
    <p class="myAnswer">We would never want you to be unhappy! If you are unsatisfied with your purchase, contact us in the first 30 days and we will give you a full refund.</p>

    <h3 class="myQuestion">How is this course different from the YouTube tutorial?</h3>
    <p class="myAnswer">My YouTube tutorial gives a quick overview of the essential Python features but it doesn't cover any of these features in detail. It's great for absolute beginners or hobbyists. If you're serious about learning Python, this course is for you.</p>
